  <p id="first">&emsp;My name is James Lemmen. 
    I am a 34 year old male. 
    Born and raised in Michigan. 
    Currently I live in California, 
    after having spent 4 years in Florida. 
    I recently obtained a certificate for Web Development with Bootstrap
  through Udemy. <br><br>&emsp;As you can see by my portfolio I have ample skills nessecary
    to complete any tasks given to me. These skills include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
    Bootstrap, React, and more.
  </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;As a web developer it is my dream to create websites that help people, such
    as those with mental disabilities, small business owners, and more. I grew up struggling to find myself
    and eventually through all the anger, depression, self hatred, I found myself
    through coding/progrramming.
  </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;I have spent many years learning all I can on my own, starting with my
    GED. After having entered a program with an estimated 2 year completion time.
    I finished with a total 56 hour completion time. For someone who couldn't focus
    on anything once I found my will to go on, I knew there was more left for me to do.
  </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;My greatest acomplishment in life was when I became a real life hero
    back in highschool. I witnessed a teacher wrongfully accused of misconduct
    all because he wouldn't fall for a students advances. After proving his innocence
    and doing the right thing, I was treated with all kinds of disrespect by both students
    and staff, however, I would do it again.
  </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;In the great words of Collosus and Deadpool "There are only 4 or 5 
    moments where you can be a hero.", I found one of them. Now I am on a quest to
    find the others. I believe that using the skills I got that saved my life
    I will be able to be a hero again and save others or improve their lives too.
