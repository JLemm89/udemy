    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Below is a list of things I like to do on my spare time. They are not listed
        in any specific order.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><h3>Video Gaming</h3></li>
        <p>I enjoy both playing and creating video games. My favorite game series
            is The Legend of Zelda series. In particuarly Twilight Princess is 
            likely my all time favorite game from the series. I also greatly
            enjoy all the Souls Series games made by FromSoftware.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Arts and Crafts</h3></li>
        <p>I really enjoy spending time creating things. My main go to is knitting
            and cross-stich. Recently I started learning how to tat(not the same as tattooing). I learned about a new 
            craft called "Swedish Weaving" that I really want to tryout.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Web Development</h3></li>
        <p>I started out creating my own websites using XAMPP/WordPress just for the fun of trying.
            I never expected it to really become more then just something to learn. It became a way for me to cope 
            with depression and even saved my life.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Programming</h3></li>
        <p>Programming became another coping tool I picked up. I first began with C++ and moved onto
            Java, and then finally to Python. I find Python to be my favorite as it 
            is the easiest for me to understand and I have managed to create more personal
            software programs with it then other languages I have learned.
        </p>
    </ul>
